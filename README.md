# Max-Sharpe-Min-Vol-Portfolio-Allocation
Performing portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulation method to build Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Minimum Volatility Portfolios. I simulate the future values of these portfolios and calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). These results are visualized using Seaborn (because Im low key a Seaborn fan) and Matplotlib.
